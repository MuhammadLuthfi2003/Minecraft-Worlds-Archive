This repository contains (almost) all of my old minecraft worlds
Worlds dated from versions :
1. Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.4.2 (2014 ish)
2. Minecraft PS3 Edition
3. Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition
4. Minecraft Nintendo Switch Edition
5. Minecraft Bedrock 

All upgraded to be able to be played in modern minecraft bedrock

to be able to play the world, simply add the .mcworld extension on the folder
and then minecraft will import it automatically (Android)

(i dont know about bedrock for PC)

to convert world from bedrock to java, simply go to
